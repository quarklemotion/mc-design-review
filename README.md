# Design Review, The App

## Staring "Rails", "Bootstrap" and "Devise"

### Some lofty goals:

* Document design review talks/presentations (scheduling)

* Provide audience with some context to who talks are for and what they can expect to gain by attending

* Enable audience to add kudos for a talk or leave comments

* Enable/encourage presenters to share their talks to RubyDev/Yammer

* Help presenter guage interest in a talk

* Give presenters a way to suggest a talk without commiting to a specific date (see above)

* Help ensure that Design Reviews continue to be useful, productive and fun

* <strike>Help break admin out of e-comm<strike>

But essentially this is just an experiment. Think of it as a hack day that took place on my train ride home.

# Contributing

1. Be warned. Nobody said this is production quality. It's a ghetto. No tests, no setup script.

2. Fixes are very welcome.

3. No-one really knows what this app is or should be so pull requests are welcome.

4. I didn't really intend to open-source this, so... I'm sorry for my sins.

5. This codebase lives in a public github repo and is deployed to the public internet. Please don't include any sensitive company information in the codebase.

Suggestions:

* Integrate with Yammer (authentication, pull profile image, post to Yammer engineering group) - I have an app and some keys for this, please ping me.

* A better way to get an overview of the upcoming talks (more talks with less detail)

* \*cough cough\* tests \*cough cough\*

* Get app off of heroku

* Consistent height of profile pics
